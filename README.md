Hello! 👋

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70662685?v=4" alt="Hello, I'm Mahmoud!"/>

My name is [**Mahmoud**](https://www.howtopronounce.com/mahmoud) and I'm a Product Manager. You can find my professional history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoudhamam). Regardless of how you got here, I'm delighted you've taken the time to learn a bit about me. Welcome! :)

The following is my **Personal User Manual**. It will give you a general idea about how I work and what you can expect from me. Whether you've worked with me or not, if you think this document could be improved, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/moudhamam/moudhamam.github.io/issues/new). I'm happy to hear feedback. 👨🏼‍💻

The goal of a user guide is to set blindingly clear expectations on how to collaborate without extra second guessing. My hope is that this will help us get to know each other faster, work better and have a stronger relationship.

> **Why Personal User Manuals?**
Dynamic products come with manuals so people can get the most out of them. It might not be needed, but it's more likely to help.
People are so much more dynamic than anything!
As you create your own user manual, you can reflect and become self-aware, while being proactive and letting others know what to expect from you and how you work best.

### My beliefs
* Since no one's malicious by nature, I always assume positive intentions until proven otherwise.
* We're all better off when we care about one another. So I try to take care of everybody in my sphere of influence.
* It is more enjoyable and effective to work in a team where everyone gives their best than to just do what is expected of them. This doesn't mean you need to work every second of your life, or never have a day off. It is about attitude. This is why I strive to hold everyone, including myself, to the same standard.
* It is more enjoyable and efficient to work when ideas are freely exchanged and feedback is obtained from other people. Transparency and candor both enhance the working environment.
* It is essential to strike a work-life balance, as it gives you the mental energy to accomplish everything. To stay in control and avoid burnout, it is wise to take breaks and allocate time for leisure activities.
* Since there can be many ways to do anything, I don't believe that there is one right way to do things. That is why I believe that what works for others might not work for me, and vice versa. I like to try new things and see what works for me.

### Getting to know me
#### What are three honest, unfiltered things about you? What should people know about you and how to get the best from you? 
1) *I'm a deep thinker and always doubt assumptions.* You should be prepared for that because I'll probably ask a question or make a comment that will make you stop and think about it. So, think and bring your wits to the discussion.
  
2) *I'm a strong believer in the art of listening.* I’m an observer of human nature and it intrigues me when I can pick up on the subtle ways that people communicate. Active listening is a skill that everyone should master, whether in a personal or professional level.
  
3) *There's a difference between a "persona" and an "authentic persona."* The former is an alter ego; the latter is your true self. If I don't know you well, I might fall into the former trap. So, when I do know you, I do everything I can to get to the real you.

#### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
1) *Be polite, respectful, and kind.* These are values that we should all live by.

2) *Listen to people who have different viewpoints* than you do and find a way to get a little out of your comfort zone. This is the only way anyone will grow.

3) *Smile and laugh often.* It makes you and those around you feel better.
  
#### What are your top three values in life?
1) *Progress.* To me, learning, improving, and gaining knowledge is eternal. I’m not a fan of stagnation or the status quo.

2) *Honesty.* I'm committed to being honest, both in my professional and personal life. Honesty requires me to be open and transparent about myself, my beliefs, my values, and my actions.

3) *Compassion.* I strive to be compassionate and mindful towards others, especially when things go wrong. It helps the people I'm in contact with, and it makes me feel good inside.
  
#### What are three things that make you feel good (bring you back to the center) when stressed? 
1) *Appreciation gestures.* I really love it when I'm appreciated. If you find that I'm adding value to the table, say it. I'll appreciate it deeply and it'll work a miracle on me.
 
2) *Doing something creative.* Drawing, painting or composing music are creative pursuits that release tension in my brain. The act of creating something, regardless of the end result, can provide a sense of accomplishment and release endorphins that can increase happiness and reduce stress.

3) *Chilling out with friends.* Going out and getting some laughs is the best antidote to stress.

#### What are the best ways to communicate with you?
1) *Face-to-face.* It's the best way to connect with people. Maybe not the most feasible though with busy calendars and remote team members.

2) *Slack (or any instant messaging app).* It's great for asynchronous conversations. And I do keep an eye on the channels and answer questions promptly when I have the time.

3) *Email.* Not my favorite way of communication, but I think it's the most efficient way to communicate long-form ideas or important information.

#### What are the worst ways to communicate with you? I don't respond well to: 
1) *Passive-aggressive emails.* They seem polite, but they actually have malicious meaning behind them. They don't encourage me to interact with you in a positive manner.

2) *Yelling.* I'd rather just talk to people who really want to talk.

3) *Inappropriate, rude language.* It's the same as yelling. I don't respond well to it.

#### What are the best ways to give you hard news or critical feedback? 
1) *Face-to-Face or video meeting.* I do respond well to feedback and need to see your face when you deliver hard news/critical feedback to me.

2) *Phone call.* If there's no way to meet or have a video call, then at least an audio call would suffice. 

3) *Email.* If you can't meet or call, then send me an email rather than starting a text chat.

#### When you are at your best, what are you doing? I am at my best when: 
1) *Inspired.* There are those moments when ideas flow clearly in your mind like a river and you feel like you're connecting with a higher force that empowers you. I do start writing down what goes in my head in order to not lose any "flow" moments like that.

2) *Challenged.* I love a good argument and debate. It's good to have some sparring partners, in professional and personal life. Challenges actually make you grow and this is one of my top values.

3) *I thrive in my job.* When I'm engaged and getting positive feedback, I feel great and I'm able to do my best at work. I do get stuck and bogged down when I feel bored or unfulfilled.

#### What are the three core values that define you as a person?
1) I value *knowledge.* It is the foundation of understanding and fuels my ambition, creativity, independence and intuition.

2) I value *people*, both on a professional or a personal level. I believe I'm enriched by people and their experiences.

3) I value *integrity*. I strive to be a person of integrity, which means honesty, fairness, and respect.

#### Do you have any pet peeves?
1) *Vague expressions*, especially when talking about some technical problems or topics like code architecture. Unless you are specific with your words, I'm going to have difficulty figuring out what exactly you mean.

2) *Bossy managers.* There's a difference between being bossy and being a leader. Being a leader means you listen to the team, support your team and make sure they succeed. They should be able to count on you. On the other hand, bossy managers underestimate you, make you feel undervalued, try to run you down and generally suck the spirit out of a team. 

3) People who *complain all the time.* I find it hard to be around complainers because they always find something to complain about. That's wasted energy and hurts anyone around.

---

#### What motivates me:
1) *Learning*. At the end of the day, I’d like to be better than I am. I want to always grow and become a better person.

2) *Making a difference*. I’ve always had the goal to make a positive impact in the lives of others.

#### What demotivates me:
1) *Repeating the same mistake*. It makes me feel stagnant. I like being a progressive person. My preference is to try something different rather than repeat something that doesn't work.

2) A culture where people prefer to lay blame on one another rather than finding the root of the problem. I prefer to look for solutions rather than point fingers and blame others.

---

#### Conditions I like to work in
1) I like having *my own desk space.* Preferably with an adjustable standing desk and a high-quality ergonomic chair.

2) *Well-lit rooms.* The more sunlight, the better.

3) *Well-ventilated and cool spaces.* Not necessarily air conditioned. Just enough cooling to make it comfortable to work.

#### Times / hours I like to work
1) My productive times can vary day by day.

2) Generally, I use purposeful planning to block out time in order to accomplish tasks.

#### Things I struggle with
1) *Micromanagement.* It can lead to unnecessary conflict, lost trust and unnecessary anxiety.

2) *Time limitations.* Having only 24 hours in a day is never enough, so I prioritize ruthlessly.

3) *Vague vision.* It's hard for me to get engaged if I don't understand the bigger picture.

#### Things I love
1) *Learning things.* Learning makes me feel alive and I really enjoy it.

2) *Music.* It lifts me up, inspires me and enhances my inner state.

#### When stressed
1) *I am less talkative.* Because silence helps me breathe slowly and think clearly, I tend to prefer quietness when I'm stressed.

2) *I tend to lose appetite.* Basically, my brain shuts down my stomach so it can conserve energy for resolving the stress issue.

#### My Blind Spots
1) Compared to the average person, I am less risk-averse. It's not uncommon for me to take risks and to think outside the box. If you feel like I'm over-confident or too optimistic, please let me know!

2) Because I rarely have time to spare, I tend to cut to the chase often. Therefore, it results in a let's-get-things-done attitude, a direct and assertive tone that may frustrate or offend someone unfamiliar with it. If this happens, don't take it personally!

---

#### Strengths
1) I analyze everything I come across, from research data to people's behavior. It makes me see patterns and connections others might miss.

2) It is easy for me to come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that most people would not have thought of. Of course, not all of these ideas are going to be feasible.

3) I am driven by a passion for learning and an intense curiosity about everything around me. Therefore, I tend to be receptive to novel ideas and ways of doing things – as long as those ideas are supported by sound reasoning.

4) I'm all about the truth. Understanding what's really going on under the surface of things is more relevant to me than taking comfort in ideology.

#### Weaknesses
1) I can get lost in my own train of thought, even when I'm with other people. It can make people feel like I'm disconnected.

2) In my opinion, rationality is the key to creating a better and happier world. Occasionally, I underestimate irrational values such as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. It can make me seem insensitive or unkind, even though my intentions are sincere.

3) I can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. My curiosity keeps me on the lookout for new ways to solve problems, learn about various topics, and learn novel ways to approach things. Taking it too far might seem like I'm constantly reinventing the wheel.

4) As much as I want to get things done, my quest for perfection sometimes gets in the way. There are times when I get lost in analyzing various options to reach the best decision.

#### Fun Facts
1) When I was a kid, my favorite toys were [Meccano](https://www.meccano.com/) and [Lego](https://www.lego.com/). I spent all my time building stuff with them. I was expected to become an architect or an engineer in the future.

2) My dream was to be a car designer. I actually won third place in a competition organized by Alfa Romeo when I was 15. I still have some sketches from then.

3) I won a chess tournament in Paris for European business schools.

#### Causes I support
1) *Helping the poor.* I believe that helping others in need is the greatest act of generosity. I feel compelled to support those who lack the same opportunities as I do.

2) *Social equality.* People should have equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background. That’s how society can function optimally.
