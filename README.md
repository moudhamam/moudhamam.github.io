#### What are three honest, unfiltered things about you? What should people know about you and how to get the best from you? 
1) *I'm a deep thinker and always doubt assumptions.* You should be prepared for that because I'll probably ask a question or make a comment that will make you stop and think about it. So, think and bring your wits to the discussion.
  
2) *I'm a strong believer in the art of listening.* I'm an observer of human nature and the world and will speak honestly about what I see. But I'm not always right and not always able to predict the future. So, don't hesitate to challenge me with your view of reality.
  
3) *There's a difference between a "persona" and an "authentic persona."* The former is an alter ego; the latter is your true self. If I don't know you well, I might fall into the former trap. So, when I do know you, I do everything I can to get to the real you.

#### What drives you nuts? Irritates you?
1) *Unfounded assumptions.* I really dislike when people make snap judgments without knowing all the facts. Data and facts are what I live by, and I refuse to go along with opinions without evidence.
  
2) *Lack of respect.* I don't accept being treated with disrespect, especially from someone of higher authority. And I'll tell you if it happens.
  
3) *Ignorance.* I have very little tolerance for ignorance and will point it out when I see it.

#### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
1) *Be polite, respectful, and kind.* These are values that we should all live by.

2) *Listen to people who have different viewpoints* than you do and find a way to get a little out of your comfort zone. This is the only way anyone will grow.

3) *Smile and laugh often.* It makes you and those around you feel better.
  
#### What are your top three values in life?
1) *Progress.* To me, learning, improving, and gaining knowledge is eternal. I‚Äôm not a fan of stagnation or the status quo.

2) *Honesty.* I'm committed to being honest, both in my professional and personal life. Honesty requires me to be open and transparent about myself, my beliefs, my values, and my actions.

3) *Compassion.* I strive to be compassionate and mindful towards others, especially when things go wrong. It helps the people I'm in contact with, and it makes me feel good inside.
  
#### What are three things that make you feel good (bring you back to the center) when stressed? 
1) *Appreciation gestures.* I really love it when I'm appreciated. If you find that I'm adding value to the table, say it. I'll appreciate it deeply and it'll work a miracle on me.
 
2) *Spending time outdoors* in the sun, soaking up the fresh air. It's that feeling of freshness and vigor that I crave. I feel less stressed when I take the time to do that.

3) *Chilling out* with friends. Going out and getting some laughs is the best antidote to stress.

#### What are the best ways to communicate with you?
1) *Face-to-face.* It's the best way to connect with people. Maybe not the most feasible though with busy calendars and remote team members.

2) *Slack (or any instant messaging app).* It's great for asynchronous conversations. And I do keep an eye on the channels and answer questions promptly when I have the time.

3) *Email.* Not my favorite way of communication, but I think it's the most efficient way to communicate long-form ideas or important information.

#### What are the worst ways to communicate with you? I don't respond well to: 
1) *Bad microphones.* When people use some crappy mics that distort your voice and make it hard to understand. If you don't have a clear mic, I'll tell you that.

2) *Passive-aggressive emails.* They seem polite, but they actually have malicious meaning behind them. They don't encourage me to interact with you in a positive manner.

3) *Yelling.* I'd rather just talk to people who really want to talk.

#### What are the best ways to give you hard news or critical feedback? 
1) *Face-to-Face or video meeting.* I do respond well to feedback and need to see your face when you deliver hard news/critical feedback to me.

2) *Phone call.* If there's no way to meet or have a video call, then at least an audio call would suffice. 

3) *Email.* If you can't meet or call, then send me an email rather than starting a text chat.

#### What are three things you'd want your team to say about you at your funeral (if you were hit by a car tomorrow)? 
1) We loved him.

2) He had made a positive impact on us.

3) He was one of a kind, honest, reliable and fun to be around.

#### When you are at your best, what are you doing? I am at my best when: 
1) *Inspired.* There are those moments when ideas flow clearly in your mind like a river and you feel like you're connecting with a higher force that empowers you. I do start writing down what goes in my head in order to not lose any "flow" moments like that.

2) *Challenged.* I love a good argument and debate. It's good to have some sparring partners, in professional and personal life. Challenges actually make you grow and this is one of my top values.

3) *I thrive in my job.* When I'm engaged and getting positive feedback, I feel great and I'm able to do my best at work. I do get stuck and bogged down when I feel bored or unfulfilled.

#### What are the three core values that define you as a person?
1) I value *knowledge.* It is the foundation of understanding and fuels my ambition, creativity, independence and intuition.

2) I value *people*, both on a professional or a personal level. I believe I'm enriched by people and their experiences.

3) I value *integrity*. I strive to be a person of integrity, which means honesty, fairness, and respect.

#### Do you have any pet peeves?
1) When we have an important discussion or an important meeting and you *act inattentive*, I take that as a sign of disrespect and unprofessionalism. It pisses me off and I'll call you out on it.

2) *Bossy managers.* There's a difference between being bossy and being a leader. Being a leader means you listen to the team, support your team and make sure they succeed. They should be able to count on you. On the other hand, bossy managers underestimate you, make you feel undervalued, try to run you down and generally suck the spirit out of a team. 

3) People who *complain all the time.* I find it hard to be around complainers because they always find something to complain about. That's wasted energy and hurts anyone around.

#### Conditions I like to work in
1) I like having *my own desk space.* Preferably with an adjustable standing desk and a high-quality ergonomic chair.

2) *Well-lit rooms.* The more sunlight, the better.

3) *Well-ventilated and cool spaces.* Not necessarily air conditioned. Just enough cooling to make it comfortable to work.

#### Times / hours I like to work
1) My productive times can vary day by day.

2) My mornings are usually dedicated to *deep work*, because that's when my mental focus is at its peak.

#### Things I struggle with
1) *Micromanagement.* It can lead to unnecessary conflict, lost trust and unnecessary anxiety.

2) *Time limitations.* Having only 24 hours in a day is never enough, so I prioritize ruthlessly.

3) *Vague vision.* It's hard for me to get engaged if I don't understand the bigger picture.

#### Things I love
1) *Learning things.* Learning makes me feel alive and I really enjoy it.

2) *Music.* It lifts me up, inspires me and enhance my inner state.
